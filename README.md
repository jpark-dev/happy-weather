# Happy Weather

My 1st Mobile App

This react-native app uses expo to display the weather information of your current location to both android/ios phones.

This app is built based on the follow-through lecture from [NomadCoders](https://nomadcoders.co/).
However, I have replaced classes with functional programming including using 'useState' and 'useEffect', instead of 'ComponentDidMount' or 'this.setState'.

This is for self-study purpose and exploring the mobile app development environment.

The initial goal is to keep this app extremely simple, but to publish it in AppStore or playStore, to experience the entire process of mobile app development.

- Node.js

- replace API_KEY in app.js (currently not in environment variable file such as .env as expo has different way of doing it.) with your api key from openweathermap.org.
